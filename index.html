        <h1>How To Play Charlie's Pig Game!</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until the chosen number is
          rolled or the player decides to "hold": If the player rolls a 1 at the
          beginning of the game, they score nothing and it becomes the next
          player's turn. <br />
          <br />
          If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total
          and the player's turn continues. If a player chooses to "hold", their
          turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's
          turn. The first player to score 100 or more points wins. <br />
          <br />
          For example, the first player, Player 1, begins a turn and rolls a 5.
          Player 1 could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again.
          Player 1 rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but
          chooses to roll again. Player 1 rolls a 1, and must end their turn
          without scoring. The next player, Player 2, rolls the sequence 4, 5,
          3, 5, 6, after which they choose to hold, and adds their turn total of
          23 points to their score.
